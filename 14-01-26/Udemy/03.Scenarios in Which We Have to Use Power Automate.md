# Section 3 – Scenarios in Which We Have to Use Power Automate

*(Short, module-wise summary)*

---

## Module 1 – Why Are We Doing This Integration?

**What this module answered**

* Integration is **not only** because Power Apps lacks features.
* Sometimes Power Apps *can* do the job, but **Power Automate does it better**.
* The real question is **architectural**:

  * Do it in Power Apps?
  * Push it to Power Automate?
  * Or move it further (Azure Functions, Web Apps)?

**How we should use this**

* If I’m only learning *how* to integrate → I can skip this section.
* If I’m deciding *whether* to integrate → this section is critical.

## Module 2 – How to Look at Power Automate When Designing a Solution

**What this module explained**

* Power Automate should be viewed as a **middle tier**, not just a helper tool.
* This mirrors classic architectures:

  * UI (Client)
  * Middle Tier (Business Logic)
  * Data Layer

**How the mapping works today**

```
Power Apps  →  UI Layer
Power Automate → Middle Tier (Logic + Integration)
Data Sources / APIs → Data Layer
```

**Key mindset shift**

* Without Power Automate → Power Apps behaves like a **2-tier system**
* With Power Automate → You unlock a **proper multi-tier architecture**

---

## Module 3 – What Power Automate Adds as a Middle Tier

**What we gain by pushing logic to Power Automate**

* Visual workflow design
* Built-in integration (300+ connectors)
* Centralized logic
* Decoupling UI from business logic

**How to think about it**

* Power Apps = interaction
* Power Automate = brain of the system

## Module 4 – Building Better Solutions with Power Automate (Email Example)

**What we compared**

* Sending email **directly from Power Apps**
* Sending email **via Power Automate**

**What we observed**

* Power Apps approach:

  * Formula-heavy
  * Harder to read
  * Harder to maintain
* Power Automate approach:

  * Fully visual
  * Easier to modify
  * Easier for others to understand

**Design takeaway**

> If logic is complex or reusable, Power Automate wins.

---

## Module 5 – Maintainability, Visual Design & Collaboration

**What this module highlighted**

* Power Automate workflows are:

  * Visually readable
  * Easy to review with business analysts
* Power Apps formulas:

  * Harder to understand for non-developers

**How this helps**

* Better maintainability
* Better collaboration
* Faster reviews and changes

---

## Module 6 – Security Through Power Automate

**What problem was shown**

* Power Apps users need **direct access** to data sources.
* That can expose:

  * Extra columns
  * Extra sheets
  * Sensitive records

**How Power Automate solves it**

```
User → Power Apps → Power Automate → Data Source
```

* Users never touch raw data
* Flow controls exactly what is read and returned

---

## Module 7 – Performance, Scalability & User Experience

**What we learned**

* Power Apps runs on client devices (limited resources).
* Power Automate runs in Microsoft data centers.

**Practical benefit**

* Heavy or long-running tasks belong in Power Automate.
* Power Apps stays responsive.

**Example**

* Add delay in flow → Power Apps finishes instantly
* Flow continues in background

---

## Module 8 – Reusability, Extensibility & Long-Running Tasks

**What Power Automate enables**

* One flow can be reused by:

  * Multiple Power Apps
* Updates apply everywhere automatically

**UX advantage**

* Fire-and-forget execution
* Notify user when job completes

---

## Module 9 – Reliability, Audit & Error Handling

**What Power Automate provides**

* Scope-based success/failure handling
* Compensation logic
* 30-day run history
* Error tracking and usage analytics

**How this helps**

* Easier troubleshooting
* Better monitoring
* Production-grade reliability

---

## Module 10 – The Big Drawback of Power Automate

**The limitation**

* ❌ No built-in version history
* ❌ No easy rollback

**Compared to Power Apps**

* Power Apps:

  * Versioning
  * Rollback
* Power Automate:

  * Manual backup & redeploy required

**Architectural implication**

* Be cautious with changes
* Treat flows as shared backend assets

---

## One-line Recall (Section 3)

> *This section taught me how to decide **when and why** to use Power Automate by treating it as a middle tier that improves maintainability, security, performance, and UX—while also understanding its limitations.*

---

## What This Section Prepares Me For Next

* Understanding **synchronous vs asynchronous calls**
* Making correct architectural decisions during integration
* Designing user-friendly, scalable Power Apps solutions
